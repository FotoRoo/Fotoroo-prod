We had a small issue on the night with poor lighting on the first photo and the attendant immediately picked up on it and corrected the issue, without being asked. There was a good selection of backdrops and props and I loved that we got digital copies of all the photos after the event. Great price and service.",

The price was also very good for 4 hours in comparison to what other companies were quoting for the same service. On the night Mak set up very quickly and was so lovely, attentive and great to be around. Would 100% recommend.",
